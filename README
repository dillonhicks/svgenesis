Installing
*************

svgenesis provides a standard setup.py distutils script for installing
a Python module. To install this module globally you may run:

bash$ python setup.py install

Alternatively, and my prefered install method, you may install it
locally:

    bash$ python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME

Installing to your home directory may mean updating your .bashrc
variables similar to the following::

    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/lib
    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/lib/python<version>/site-packages


Testing svgenesis
******************

To test the svgenesis module without installing, you will need to run
the test_setup.sh script::

    bash$ . testrc


The module provides a test script as well as unit tests. The unit
tests are mainly to verify the installation and to show everything is
working as expected, while the tests scripts show how to use the
module.

Unit Tests
-----------

The Unit Tests are found in `tests' directory, sibling to the
`svgenesis' directory and my be run by executing::

    bash$ make tests
